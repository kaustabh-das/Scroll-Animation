# Scroll Animation
 In this mini project I create a cool javascript scroll animation by creatng a paper plane flying on the screen.

I will use few libraries, GSAP TweenLite will be used to take care of animating different properties of the image, bazier plugin will be used to create a path for the image to follow along. TimelineLite can be used to sequence together multiple animation and ScrollMagic will help us animate based on scroll.
